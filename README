The cpssp package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c or later
(see http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt).


The cpssp package allows you to draw a two-dimensional representation of
a proteinâ€™s secondary structure in LaTeX. Besides, it is possible to
graphically compare protein secondary structure predictions. One can both
compare predictions from a single program for several protein sequences
(which have been aligned using any appropriate algorithm) and predictions
from several programs for a single protein sequence.


Installation: Run cpssp.ins through LaTeX and follow the instructions.
